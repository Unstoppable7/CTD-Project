            <p class="lead text-body-secondary">Hello team,</p>
            <p class="lead text-body-secondary">
              My name is <span class="fw-bold">Cristian Rosales</span> and I
              am excited to present my project to you. This project is based on
              the Art Institute of Chicago API and offers a platform to explore
              artworks, artists and exhibitions in an intuitive and efficient
              way.
            </p>
            <p class="lead text-body-secondary">
              Upon entering the platform, users find three main sections:
              <span class="fw-bold">Artworks</span>,
              <span class="fw-bold">Artists</span> and
              <span class="fw-bold">Exhibitions</span>. Each section features
              a list of cards representing corresponding items, such as
              paintings, sculptures, individual artists, or exhibitions.
            </p>
            <p class="lead text-body-secondary">
              A key feature of the platform is pagination capability, which
              allows users to explore a large number of elements without having
              to load the page excessively with data. Additionally, the navigation bar includes a
              search engine that allows users to search for specific items using
              search terms.
            </p>
            <p class="lead text-body-secondary">
              Each card in the item list includes a "<span class="fw-bold"
                >Details</span
              >" button that takes users to a dedicated page with additional
              information about the selected item. For example, in the details
              of a Artwork, users can find information about the artist or
              artists who created it. From there, they can directly access the
              details for that artist.
            </p>
            <p class="lead text-body-secondary">
              Similarly, in the details of an artist or an exhibition, a list of
              related artworks is displayed. This allows users to explore more
              works of art and delve deeper into the context and history behind
              each one.
            </p>
            <p class="lead text-body-secondary">
              In summary, my project offers a complete experience to explore and
              discover art through an intuitive and friendly interface. I'm
              excited to share it with you and I hope you enjoy it as much as I
              enjoyed creating it.
            </p>
